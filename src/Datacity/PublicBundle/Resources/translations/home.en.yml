    title: Innovation
    description: > 
      DataCity gathers data from different public portals, as well as those of the open source projects of type
      OpenStreet Map, to standardize them. Once these data are processed, DataCity offers to communities
      custom applications thanks to Datacity's Applications Store.
      These are paid or offered for rent for a determined period, 
      they include services such as maintenance, hosting, SEO ... In other words,
      DataCity is an application portal for users and they will be able, in their turn, to offer mobile apps.

    title: Our Users
    description: > 
      Our main users are the communities and their citizens.
      However they aren't the only target of DataCity. Indeed, developers who would recover
      data stored on our server can also use the API DataCity as they want.
